\chapter{Conclusion}\label{cap5}

The conclusions should summarize and provide a unifying perspective on the work carried out. A brief reference may be made to the work of others with similarities to the work carried out and to the knowledge that has resulted from the work carried out, as well as suggestions for future work. The coherence of the document means that the conclusions must be consistent with the ideas set out in the introduction.
