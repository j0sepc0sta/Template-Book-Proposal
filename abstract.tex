\chapter*{Abstract}
The abstract (no more than 250 words) makes it possible to assess the interest of a document and makes it easier to identify it in a bibliographic search in databases where the document is referenced. 

It is recommended that the summary briefly addresses:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Main objectives and theme or motivations for the work; 
	\item Methodology used (when necessary for understanding the report); 
	\item Results, analyzed from a global point of view; 
	\item Conclusions and consequences of the results, and link to the objectives of the work.
\end{itemize}

As this report template is aimed at work that focuses mainly on software development, some of these components may be less emphasized, and information on the work's analysis, design, and implementation may be added.

The abstract should not contain references.
